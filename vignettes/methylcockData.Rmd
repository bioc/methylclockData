# Overview

The methylclockData package is a repository of a few public datasets that
needs the *methylclock* package to estimate chronological and gestational DNA 
methylation (DNAm) age as well as biological age using different methylation clocks.

We use the data from package `meffil` (@min2018meffil) that provides some
functions to estimate cell counts using predefined datasets. 

## Chronological DNAm age (in years)

- **Horvath's clock**: It uses 353 CpGs described in @horvath2013dna. It was trained using 27K and 450K arrays in samples from different tissues. Other three different age-related biomarkers are also computed:
     - **AgeAcDiff** (DNAmAge acceleration difference): Difference between DNAmAge and chronological age.
     - **IEAA** (Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration): Residuals obtained after regressing DNAmAge and chronological age adjusted by cell counts.  
     - **EEAA** (Extrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration): Residuals obtained after regressing DNAmAge and chronological age. This measure was also known as DNAmAge acceleration residual in the first Horvath's paper.
- **Hannum's clock**: It uses 71 CpGs described in @hannum2013genome. It was trained using 450K array in blood samples. Another are-related biomarer is also computed:
     - **AMAR** (Apparent Methylomic Aging Rate): Measure proposed in @hannum2013genome computed as the ratio between DNAm age and the chronological age.
- **BNN**: It uses Horvath's CpGs to train a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to predict DNAm age as described in @alfonso2018.
- **Horvath's skin+blood clock (Horvath2)**: Epigenetic clock for skin and blood cells. It uses 391 CpGs described in @horvath2018epigenetic. It was trained using 450K EPIC arrays in skin and blood sampels.
- **PedBE clock**: Epigenetic clock from buccal epithelial swabs. It's intended purpose is buccal samples from individuals aged 0-20 years old. It uses 84 CpGs described in @mcewen2019pedbe. The authors gathered 1,721 genome-wide DNAm profiles from 11 different cohorts with individuals aged 0 to 20 years old. 
- **Wu's clock**: It uses 111 CpGs described in @wu2019dna. It is designed to predict age in children. It was trained using 27K and 450K.

## Gestational DNAm age (in weeks)

- **Knight's clock**: It uses 148 CpGs described in @knight2016epigenetic. It was trained using 27K and 450K arrays in cord blood samples.
- **Bohlin's clock**: It uses 96 CpGs described in @bohlin2016prediction. It was trained using 450K array in cord blood samples.
- **Mayne's clock**: It uses 62 CpGs described in @mayne2017accelerated. It was trained using 27K and 450K.
- **Lee's clocks**: Three different biological clocks described in @lee2019placental are implemented. It was trained for 450K and EPIC arrays in placenta samples.
     - **RPC clock**: Robust placental clock (RPC). It uses 558 CpG sites.
     - **CPC clock**: Control placental clock (CPC). It usses 546 CpG sites.
     - **Refined RPC clock**: Useful for uncomplicated term pregnancies (e.g. gestational age >36 weeks). It uses 396 CpG sites.


The biological DNAm clocks implemented in our package are:

- **Levine's clock** (also know as PhenoAge): It uses 513 CpGs described in @levine2018epigenetic. It was trained using 27K, 450K and EPIC arrays in blood samples.
- **Telomere Length's clock** (TL): It uses 140 CpGs described in @lu2019dna It was trained using 450K and EPIC arrays in blood samples.


# How to load data

In the below example, we show how one can download this dataset from 
ExperimentHub.

```{r get-tcga}
library(ExperimentHub)

# Get experimentHub records
eh <-  ExperimentHub()

# Get data about methylclockData experimentHub
pData <- query(eh , "methylclockData")

# Get information rows about methylclockData
df <- mcols(pData)
df

# Retrieve data
pData["EH3913"]

# Download data
# data <- pData[["EH3913"]]

```
